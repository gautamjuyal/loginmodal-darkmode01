# loginmodal-darkmode01
Created a custom login modal (dark mode) using HTML and CSS.
---------------------------------------------------------------

What the modal is missing?
Of course, it can't be interacted with.
1. No navbar.
2. No footer.
3. No js is applied.
4. a button can be created to toggle between light and dark mode.
5. custom checkboxed, since the default ones look hideous.
